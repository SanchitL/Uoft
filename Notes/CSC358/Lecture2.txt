Sessions

- Interactive: Short messages, small delay, high reliability
- File Transfer: Long messages, moderate delay, high reliability.
- Digitized Voice: Short Messages, fixed small delay. moderate reliability
- Web Traffic: Long messages, small delay, high reliability
- Video: Long messages, fixed small delay. Requires broadcast and multicast capabilities.
    -> Circuit switched

How to Master Complexity?

- Computer networks are very complex; many issuses to address:
    - connection setup, message segmentation, multiplexing, routing, flow control, security, error control, 
    encoding, addressing, ...
- Useful method for dealing with complexity is using "modularity".
    - break complex problem into simpler sub problem
    - use "black box" abstraction for sub-problems

Modularity for Computer Networks

- Hierarchical Layering: THe type of functional modularity used for computer networks is hierarchical layering. What is special about this architecture is that it is distributed and connected through unreliable links with delays.
- Example: Postal Service
    - When I bring a letter to the post office, I don't know how it gets delivered from there. THe office clerk doesn't know the exact details either, and so on.


Layered Network Architecture

Application Layer
------------------
Transport Layer
-----------------
Network Layer
-----------------
Data Link Layer
-----------------
Physical Layer
-----------------

There are several ways to define a layered network architecture.

Application Layer

- Service: Supports applications
- Task: 
    - connection setup
    - flow control
    - error control

- Protocols: HTTP to support Web
- Location: local file system

Transport Layer

- Service: Prepares messages for being transported over the network.
- Task: 
    - Message fragmentation and reassembly
    - Flow control
    - Congestion control
    - Error control
    - Connection setup
- Protocols: TCP, UDP
- Location: End Systems/Hosts

Network Layer

- Service: Sends data units over the network
- Taks: 
    - routing
    - addressing
    - congestion control
- Protocols: IP
- Location: End System/Hosts + Routers

Data Link Layer

- Service: Sends data units over a links
- Tasks: 
    - Framing
    - Error
    - Retransmissions
- Protocols: ARQ: CSMA/CD for Ethernet and wave Layering
- Location: End System/Hosts + Routers

Physical Layer

- Service: Sends bits over a links
- Task: 
    - Modem (Modulator/Demodulator)
- Location: End Systems/Host + Routers
