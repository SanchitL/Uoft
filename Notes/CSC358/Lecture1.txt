Computer Networks Lecture 1

What is a Computer Network?

- Goal: Provides service(s) that allow to send information from
one host to another host.

- Information: Data, Video, Voice, Sound, Graphics, ...

- Service: 
    - Network Infrastructure (hardware)
    - Protocols (software)


Overview:

- Host/End-Systems run Network Applications

- Switches/Routers/Nodes and Links connect End-Systems

- End-Systems and Routers use Protocols to communicate
    - FTP, TCP, IP

- Services can be Connection-Oriented or Connectionless.


Classification:

- Scope of the Networks 
    - Personal Area Networks (PAN)
    - Local Area Networks (LAN)
    - Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN)
    - Wide Area Networks (WAN)

- Transmission Technology
    - Shard-Media-Broadcast Networks
    - Switched Point-to-Point Networks

- Switched Point-to-Point Networks
    - Circuit-Switched Networks
    - Packet-Switched Networks

- Packet-Switched Networks
    - Connection-Oriented (Virtual-Circuit Routing)
    - Connectionless (Datagram Routing, Dynamic Routing)


- Shared-Media-Broadcast Channels

    - Pros: simple, cheap
    - Cons: no scalability

- Point-to-Point Network

    - Switched Point-to-Point Networks
        - Circuit-Switched -> Landline
            - Pros: Quality of Service
            - Cons: Inefficient
        - Packet Switched ->
